Welcome to the Topl <<glossary:BaaS>> platform documentation :owlbert-reading: 

In this brief guide, we'll walk you through how to leverage our managed node solution for connecting to the Topl blockchain so that you can access information about specific products at any point in the supply chain and provide others not only reports of [<<glossary:ESG>>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance) claims but tangible proof of them. 

This documentation will follow the flow of a developer that will be onboarding an organization and creating projects that will interface with Topl's network through <<glossary:BaaS>>.
