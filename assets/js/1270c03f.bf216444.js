In essence, a Topl transaction is just a few bytes of data and has to reach any one of many Bifrost nodes. The senders do not need to trust the nodes they use to broadcast the transaction, as long as they use more than one to ensure that it propagates. The nodes don't need to trust the sender or establish the sender's \"identity\". Because the transaction is signed and contains no confidential information, private keys, or credentials, it can be publicly broadcast using the JSON-RPC routes. Unlike credit card transactions, for example, which contain sensitive information and can only be transmitted on an encrypted network, a Topl transaction can be sent over any network.

The entire network forms a loosely connected mesh without a fixed topology or any other structure, making all nodes equal peers. Messages, including transactions and blocks, are propagated from each node to the peers to which it is connected. A new validated transaction injected into any node on the network will be sent to three or four of the neighboring nodes, each of which will send it to three to four more nodes, and so on.
