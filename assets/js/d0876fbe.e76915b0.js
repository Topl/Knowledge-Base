If between periods n+1 has \u03b4% more transactions than in period n, then sqrt(\u03b4)% $TOPLs are minted and distributed through block rewards. Since this block reward is distributed proportionally to all $TOPL holders active over the previous period, we consider this inflation non-dilutive as the proportional share of all $TOPLs that an honest and active participant will have never decreases due to throughput inflation.
