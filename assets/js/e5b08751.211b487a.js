For example, if a blockchain\u2019s staking token has a total market cap of $100MM, but only $60MM of those tokens are actively staking, the cost to compromise the network is not $50MM (plus $0.01), but rather only $30MM."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Emergent Pools.")," Delegation is the conventional answer to how to enable smaller token holders to participate in staking rewards for a protocol. While certainly the simplest solution, delegation does greatly increase the level of centralization and, therefore, the risk of centralized modes of failure, as it\u2019s not uncommon to see 20-30% of a token\u2019s total supply in a single pool. Instead of focusing on delegation, Topl once again takes advantage of its unique consensus protocol to enable a novel solution. Block production in Taktikos is divided into slots or rounds (much as it may be in a BFT protocol); during each round, each staker will be assigned one or more eligibilities to produce a block for that round. While only one staker will be able to produce a block in a round, each honest staker who is not chosen can still cryptographically publish their eligibilities to be included in the block and subsequently earn a share of the block\u2019s rewards.

The mechanism is originally inspired by the block reward design found in Zcash, in which a portion of the block rewards is assigned to a Zcash development fund. While in Zcash, the share of block rewards to the development fund is a fixed 20%, the rate of new tokens produced to fund the Topl stewards is variable and controlled via a $TOPL holder vote (see table below)."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Throughput Inflation.")," Complementary to the $TOPL\u2019s growth, inflation is a secondary, non-dilutive inflation mechanism. In effect, this second mechanism of inflation looks at the change between two epochs in blockchain\u2019s total transaction throughput and, based on that delta, mints and distributes new $TOPL proportionally to all active $TOPL holders. If between periods n+1 has \u03b4% more transactions than in period n, then sqrt(\u03b4)% $TOPLs are minted and distributed through block rewards. Since this block reward is distributed proportionally to all $TOPL holders active over the previous period, we consider this inflation non-dilutive as the proportional share of all $TOPLs that an honest and active participant will have never decreases due to throughput inflation. The purpose is to further incentivize active staking on the network and discourage passive free-riding on the token\u2019s price appreciation."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
