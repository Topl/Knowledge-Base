If you're new to blockchain, we recommend you first begin with the remainder of this Key Concepts section in order to gain familiarity with the design patterns of blockchain networks.

This section is may also be useful for getting to know the specifics of Topl's blockchain design as there are a few unique aspects to be aware of if you are migrating from a different blockchain network.
