All requests submitted through BaaS require an API key. This allows our service to authenticate your account to enforce API quotas. 

It is mandatory that you sign up for a free API key which allows for many advantages: 
* a **high request rate** and concurrent request limit
* **fast** responses with few retries and timeouts
* useful **metric tracking** for performance tuning and to analyze your customer behavior
* Access to our Genus offerings including the ability to query archived data and advanced logging capabilities (not yet released)

#Authenticating using a Project Id

BaaS Vertx API  requires a valid `Project Id` to be included with your request traffic. This identifier should be appended to the request URL.


[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "https://vertx.topl.services/${network}/YOUR-PROJECT-ID",
      "language": "curl"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]
#Authenticating using a ProjectId and API Key

As additional protection for your request traffic, an API key is required to access our API. Please ensure that you keep your `API KEY` a secret! 


[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "curl --header `x-api-key:YOUR-API-KEY` \\\nhttps://vertx.topl.services/${network}/YOUR-PROJECT-ID",
      "language": "curl"
    }
  ]
