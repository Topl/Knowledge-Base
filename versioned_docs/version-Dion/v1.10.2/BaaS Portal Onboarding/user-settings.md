## User Settings

Once users have finished the registration process, they can update their details in the settings. This will ensure that users will have the highest level of support and guidance possible during the initial phases of the Topl launch. 

Users can find the settings by clicking on Settings in the left-hand navigation bar.


From here, the user will see a menu which will allow you to update your information so that Topl will be able to provide the highest quality service for our users. 

## Change Password

From the user settings menu, you can also change your password.
