Address">​</a></h2><p>In the context of blockchain, an address is a unique digital location represented by a string of alphanumeric characters. It serves as a destination for sending or receiving cryptocurrency within the network. Each address is associated with a wallet, which is equivalent to an account in other blockchains. </p><p>In the Topl protocol, addresses are single-use, meaning they are generated and used only once. This enhances security and privacy while maintaining the functionality of sending and receiving transactions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="aes">AES<a href="#aes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AES" title="Direct link to AES">​</a></h2><p>Advanced Encryption Standard, it is a symmetric-key algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its use by the NSA led to it becoming one of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="application-tiers">Application tiers<a href="#application-tiers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Application tiers" title="Direct link to Application tiers">​</a></h2><p><strong>Tier 0</strong>: Traditional centralized application where verifiable claims are neither committed to nor posted to a public network. In this model, business logic is executed by the organization and wallets are not part of the application.</p><p><strong>Tier 1</strong>: Traditional centralized application where verifiable claims are committed to and posted to a public network. In this model, organizations both execute business logic and administer multiple wallets to manage their on-chain assets.</p><p><strong>Tier 2</strong>: Partially decentralized application where verifiable claims are committed to and posted to a public network. In this model, users become participants by maintaining their own wallets and interacting with organizations to sign transactions. Organizations are responsible for executed business logic and constructing unsigned blockchain transactions which are then sent to the user for their signature. Upon approving and signing the transaction, the user sends the signed transaction back to the organization for any further processing and broadcast to the public network.</p><p><strong>Tier 3</strong>: Fully decentralized application where verifiable claims are committed to and posted to a public network. In this model, users become fully autonomous and no longer rely on the organization to construct transactions on their behalf. Organizations make available their business logic on the public network and users execute this logic to construct their own transactions, sign them, and broadcast them to the public network.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asset">Asset<a href="#asset" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Asset" title="Direct link to Asset">​</a></h2><p>An asset in the Topl Blockchain Protocol is a securely created, verified, and stored unit of value or information.

It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf</a>) by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin has lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and unlike government issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority. Since Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, there are no physical bitcoins only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to. All bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins. Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as &quot;BTC&quot;</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="blockchain">Blockchain<a href="#blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blockchain" title="Direct link to Blockchain">​</a></h2><p>In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained within a distributed network of peer nodes.
