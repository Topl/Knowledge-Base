# BramblPy

Python 3 implementation of Topl's API library. Currently in pre-alpha release, and slated for public availability by late Q4 2021. Please contact us for early access.

# Key Generation and Transaction Signing

While Topl provides full access to its blockchain network through our Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) hosted API, there is certain functionality that must be executed off chain as part of your application itself.

Therefore, in addition to being able to call all routes comprising the BaaS API, Brambl enables you to both generate and manage your key files as well as sign transactions.

#Smart Contracts
Topl plans on providing functionality for smart contracts off the chain by the end of Q2 2021 and smart contracts on chain by the end of Q3 2021. Please contact us if you are interested in learning more!
