## Organization Basics

After creating the organization, you can then add the name for the organization as well as the email linked to the organization. This email will only be used for information purposes to inform the organization about updates to our services and will not be sold to any third parties.

## Organization Real-World Address Onboarding

The admin can then add the real world-address to the organization

:::warning

Please note that the real-world address has no correlation to the address that is used to make transactions on the Topl Blockchain.

## Choose a subscription option

The next step will be to choose a subscription option out of the following three options depending on your organization's needs and capability for growth.

* Startup
  * For small-scale initiatives and startups with a high growth potential
* Professional
  * Mid-market challengers and clients with existing platforms
* Enterprise
  * Market leaders and enterprise clients with existing platforms

### Billing Information

* Our billing is handled by Stripe, so an admin that chooses one of our paid options should go to Stripe to enter the payment information

## Polys

* Polys are the cryptocurrency that is used to pay for transactions on the Topl Blockchain network.
* Each transaction on the Topl Blockchain takes a certain number of nanopolys (10^-9 polys) in order to make a transaction.
* Please reach out to Chris Georgen at <c.georgen@topl.me> for special deals on polys.
* Please look at the tutorial for [Adding Polys](doc:adding-polys) for more detailed instructions

:::info

You may see language referring to "Transaction Credits". Note that this is a synonym for polys and that we are working to deprecate this term.

:::info

Why do transaction fees exist? Forgers on the Topl Network stake arbits to validate transactions. These transactions are bundled into blocks by forgers and appended to the Blockchain\n- Once a transaction becomes part of a block on the Topl Blockchain, it is considered confirmed. Moreover, the more blocks that are forged on top of the block containing the transaction, the less likely the transaction is to be modified. In return for their service, forgers receive a block reward for each block and the total sum of transaction fees attached by users. Currently, the transaction fee is set at 1 poly, but once decentralization begins, the transaction fee will be based on the market value of each transaction.

## User Creation

Owners for organizations that have a Professional subscription can create new users to be associated with an organization.

## Editing an Organization

Once you have created your organization, any admin can return to view its information or update the information at any time.

To begin, simply open your list of organizations and choose the Organization that you wish to view or edit.

![edit organization](https://files.readme.io/17e5c3b-edit_organization_2.gif)

1. Update your Organization's Basic Information
2. Update your Organization's Mailing Address
3. Change Subscription
4. Load Polys into an Address
5. Add Team Members (Professional Subscription Required)
6. Manage Projects
