To the right of the overview screen on the header, there is a button from which you can search recent blocks. Blocks are chained to each other in the order that they are created and always contain the unique hash number of the previous block.

This view of the blocks is constantly updated with newer blocks entering at the top and pushing older blocks down the list. The blocks are sized (in KB) proportionally to the number of transactions executed, so the larger the size, the more transactions that were included in the block. This size depends on how many people have been trying to transact during a certain period, and how many of those transactions have been validated. 

A transaction becomes more "final" as new blocks are added onto the existing chain since the deeper a block is buried, the more likely that everyone on the network will have heard about it. 

The table also contains the <<glossary:Block Height>>, block ID, timestamp when the block was forged, and the generator that was used to forge the block. 

Once blocks are created, the records that they contain are permanent and can't be altered or deleted. This is what makes blockchain technology tamper-proof as only new data can be added on the block.
