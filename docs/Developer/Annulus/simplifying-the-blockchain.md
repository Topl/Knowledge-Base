# Simplifying the Blockchain

If you'd like to become confident in using a Topl block explorer and fully understand its functionality, we're here to guide you through Annulus. To start off, you can open up [Annulus](https://toplnet.annulus.topl.services/) in your web browser and follow along using the guide.

First, what's a block explorer? To provide some basic terms, a <<glossary:Block Explorer>> is a blockchain search engine that allows you to search for a particular piece of information on the blockchain. The activities carried out on blockchains are known as <<glossary:Transaction>>s, which occur when crypto-tokens are sent to and from wallet addresses. Blocks on the blockchain are collections of transactions that were processed and approved by special nodes known as forgers.

To recap, a <<glossary:Block Explorer>> is an online tool to view all transactions that have taken place on the blockchain, the current network hash rate, and transactions between blockchain addresses, amongst other useful information. You can think of it as a window into the blockchain world, giving you the opportunity to observe what's happening there. 

Our block explorer visually displays block activity as it is confirmed in real-time, which allows users to take a more engaged approach to the data. Users can look up a particular block height, and inspect it at another level by viewing the transaction details that make up a block.

# Who uses a Block Explorer?
For one, developers and users, who often exchange polys and assets will utilize the block explorer to check on the status of their transactions. Once users initiate transactions, they will receive an automatically generated transaction hash and can use it to look up details of the transaction and whether it was successful. 

Forgers will use the block explorer to confirm significant block activity, especially to check if they have been successful in generating a particular block, which means they will receive the block reward. 

Have fun on your blockchain journey! Our aim for the block explorer is a no-frills, user-friendly tool that gives users easy access to data from multiple search vantages and provides a more intuitive understanding of the data.
