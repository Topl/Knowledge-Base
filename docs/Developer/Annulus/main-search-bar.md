#Main Search Bar

The main search bar is where you can look up something specific right away. As a block explorer user, you can perform a search for either a block (by height or by block hash) or a transaction (by ID or transaction hash).

One common use case that you can try on the block explorer is checking on the status of a transaction. (We always recommend the copy and paste method to prevent typing errors!)

Within a block, there can be hundreds of approved transactions, so we do not recommend searching for a specific transaction by scrolling through the pages (of course, unless you want to!).
