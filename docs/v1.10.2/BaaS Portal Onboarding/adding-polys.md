# How can I get Polys? 
It's actually pretty easy, follow these steps: 

#First Step
  After logging into the BaaS Portal, go to Settings and find the Purchase Polys section on the page. From there, you can transfer funds to the address directly through the UI!

  "body": "Polys used on our testing network our free, however, you will have to pay to acquire polys on our main network. In addition, you can only request one faucet transaction on the testnet for every 6 hours. This ensures that there will be enough test polys for all of our users."

If you are wanting to add polys to an account on our mainnet (toplnet), please follow the steps above but use the mainnet dropdown instead of the valhalla dropdown. You should be redirected to stripe where you can purchase polys on the main network.
