# Glossary
Here are a few terms and definitions relevant to both the Topl protocol and web3 in general. <br>
**Items with a ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png) indicate a term that is specific to the Topl protocol.*

<br>

## AES
Advanced Encryption Standard, it is a symmetric-key algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data, developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and its use by the NSA led to it becoming one of the most widely used cryptographic algorithms.

## Application tiers
**Tier 0**: Traditional centralized application where verifiable claims are neither committed to nor posted to a public network. In this model, business logic is executed by the organization and wallets are not part of the application.<br>
**Tier 1**: Traditional centralized application where verifiable claims are committed to and posted to a public network. In this model, organizations both execute business logic and administer multiple wallets to manage their on-chain assets.<br>
**Tier 2**: Partially decentralized application where verifiable claims are committed to and posted to a public network. In this model, users become participants by maintaining their own wallets and interacting with organizations to sign transactions. Organizations are responsible for executed business logic and constructing unsigned blockchain transactions which are then sent to the user for their signature. Upon approving and signing the transaction, the user sends the signed transaction back to the organization for any further processing and broadcast to the public network.<br>
**Tier 3**: Fully decentralized application where verifiable claims are committed to and posted to a public network. In this model, users become fully autonomous and no longer rely on the organization to construct transactions on their behalf. Organizations make available their business logic on the public network and users execute this logic to construct their own transactions, sign them, and broadcast them to the public network.


## Asset
An asset is created by the Topl Blockchain Protocol utilizing cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and a public ledger to regulate the creation of new units, verify transactions involving assets, and secure the transactions without the intervention of any middleman. A Topl Asset are generated by transactions and contain the information that the user wants to store on the blockchain.

## Asset code
An Asset Code is a unique identifier for user issued Assets generated from the version, issuer address, and the name provided by the user.

## AST
abstract syntax tree; an abstract representation of code

## BaaS ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png)

## Bifrost ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png)
Topl protocol reference client implementation written in Scala.
Project Bifrost is a Scala client designed over a cryptocurrency/blockchain protocol developed to achieve three specific goals: 

1.) Facilitate movement and investment of capital from investors in developed economies to businesses in developing economies 

2.) Create a commodity market that collateralizes a stable currency via storage and redemption 

3.) Develop a reputation system and historical reference of business behavior

## Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created in January 2009. It follows the ideas set out in a whitepaper (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. The identity of the person or persons who created the technology is still a mystery. Bitcoin has lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms and unlike government issued currencies, it is operated by a decentralized authority. Since Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, there are no physical bitcoins only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to. All bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of computing power. Bitcoins are not issued or backed by any banks or governments, nor are individual bitcoins valuable as a commodity. Despite it not being legal tender, Bitcoin is very popular and has triggered the launch of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies, collectively referred to as altcoins. Bitcoin is commonly abbreviated as "BTC"

## Blockchain
In general terms, a blockchain is an immutable transaction ledger, maintained within a distributed network of peer nodes. These nodes each maintain a copy of the ledger by applying transactions that have been validated by a consensus protocol, grouped into blocks that include a hash that binds each block to the preceding block.

## Byte
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits. 

## Byzantine Fault Tolerance
Byzantine Fault Tolerance is the characteristic which defines a system that tolerates the class of failures that belong to the Byzantine Generals' problem. Byzantine Failure is the most difficult class of failure. It implies no restrictions, and makes no assumptions about the kind of behavior a node can have (e.g. a node can generate any kind of arbitrary data while posing as an honest actor) Byzantine Faults are the most severe and difficult to deal with. Even SpaceX was considering it as a potential requirement for their systems.

## Consensus
Blockchains are inherently decentralized systems which consist of different actors who act differently depending on their incentives and on the information that is available to them. Whenever a new transaction gets broadcasted to the network, nodes have the option to include that transaction to their copy of their ledger or to ignore it. When the majority of the actors which comprise the network decide on a single state, consensus is achieved.

## Consensus mechanism
A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrency. It is useful in record-keeping, among other things

## CPE
Chain Program Engine; shared state VM for business logic execution

## Cryptocurrency
A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography which makes it virtually impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on Blockchain technology. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them immune to government interference or manipulation.

## Curve25519
Topl uses Curve25519 to generate public and private key pairs and for signing transactions.

## Daml
Digital Asset Modeling Language; higher-order (chain agnostic) contract language for writing business logic. centered around assets, individual user definitions, and built-in privacy. Some pre-made front-ends out of the box that can be extended be used to extended functionality of products such as Lattice and RaaS. Cardano has something similar with Marlowe / Plutus.

## Dion ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png)

## Elliptic Curve Cryptography
A powerful cryptography algorithm https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/

## Epoch
Long time scale in Ouroboros, epochs are composed of many slots

## Escrow
An escrow does duties as a representative of a concerned account. Escrow can always pay obligations, with the help of signature funds, allocated to pay those debts. Escrow main duty is to help to dispense money or documents as a neutral third party in different exchanges. They do not release their contents until agreed conditions are met. Their duty acting in the blockchain are not transferring and holding funds for the next payment but rather in bartering public and private keys.

## ESG
Environmental, Social, and Governance criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward of nature. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, audits, internal controls, and shareholder rights.

## Ethereum
Launched in 2015, Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own cryptocurrency: ether. It enables Smart Contracts and Distributed Applications (ĐApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. In addition, Ethereum is also a programming language (Turing complete) running on the blockchain, helping developers to build and publish distributed applications.

## GCP
Google cloud platform; a cloud compute platform for running servers and accessing other services

## Genus
A service that provides a data layer between analytics tools (dApps) and the Topl Blockchain to be used for data analytics and other use cases where querying the blockchain is necessary.

## HD-KES
Hierarchical Deterministic Key Evolving Signature; mechanism for extending the time-to-live of an underlying KES scheme. Constraint: header size vs. network latency. Cardano impl: 3 months 

## Hexadecimal
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal

## JSON-RPC
JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol encoded in JSON. It is similar to the XML-RPC protocol, defining only a few types and commands. JSON-RPC allows for notifications (data sent to the server that does not require a response) and for multiple calls to be sent to the server which may be answered asynchronously. 

## KES
Key-Evolving Signature; mechanism for securing chain selection process in Ouroboros proof-of-stake

## LDD
Local dynamic difficulty, Short timescale variation of the block production eligibility threshold. 

## Nakamoto Consensus
An incentive driven, probabilistic consensus algorithm where chain extension eligibility is determined via a race condition, originally presented in the Bitcoin whitepaper.

## Nodes
The real-life machines that store the state of the Topl Blockchain. Nodes communicate with each other to propagate information about the Topl Blockchain state and new state changes. The Topl network itself is the aggregate of all Topl nodes and their communications.

## P2PKH
"Pay to Public Key Hash". At the most basic level, this means "pay to this Topl address". It serves as an instruction on the blockchain for users wanting to transfer assets to each other.

## Payment Key
Cryptographic key, needed by all, responsible for authorizing moving coins (or tokens)

## Permissionless blockchain
Permissionless blockchains are blockchains that require no permission to join and interact with. They are also known as public blockchains. Most of the time, permissionless blockchain is ideal for running and managing digital currencies. In a permissionless blockchain, a user can create a personal address and then interact with the network by either helping the network to validate transactions or simply send transactions to another user on the network. The very first type of permissionless blockchain is Bitcoin. Ethereum is also permissionless.

## POC
proof of concept; simplest toy implementation that demonstrates a working idea

## Proposition
Topl uses the language of proposition to refer to the methodology used to produce the public key used in signing transactions.

## Provider
A **provider** is an abstraction of a connection to a Topl network, providing a concise, consistent interface to standard Topl node functionality.

## Rewards address
A rewards address is specifically when someone forges a new block, the rewards for forging that new block will go to the rewards address. Any normal address can be used, it is just a normal address that is declared by the Bifrost node that is forging blocks.

## Slot
Atomic time unit in Ouroboros, smallest piece of time (~1 second for Topl, 2 for Cardano)

## Smart contract
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained therein exist across a distributed, decentralized Blockchain network. The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism.

## Staking Key
Cryptographic key, needed by stakers, responsible for securely extending the chain

## Taktikos ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png)
The regularized Nakamoto-style proof-of-stake consensus algorithm that powers the Topl protocol. The Taktikos staking mechanism reduces variance in the distribution of time intervals between blocks by means of a time-varying leader election process. This quality of regularization significant improvements for transaction throughput and finality guarantees in a proof-of-stake protocol.

## Tetra ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png)
Next major release of Topl protocol. Introduces Taktikos and additional features (exUTxO, event sourcing, CPE refactor)

## Topl blockchain address ![Topl-specific](https://topl.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/topl_leaf-e1685656880285.png)
The topl blockchain address is a unique sequence of numbers and letters that functions similarly to an email address. In particular, the numbers and letters are Base58 (https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-msporny-base58-01.html).  The Topl Blockchain address refers to a specific destination on the network where Topl cryptocurrency can be sent to. For example, imagine that you want to make a transaction on the Topl network with your friend Bob. Bob will share his address with you and you will be able to transact with him via this address.

## Transaction
A transaction refers to crypto-asset transactions that occur on the <<glossary:Blockchain>> and remain dependent on the state of the blockchain for their validity. On-chain transactions are considered valid only when the blockchain has been updated to reflect transactions on the public ledger. On-chain transactions offer security and transparency since they can't be altered once they're verified and recorded on the network. However, there are some drawbacks to on-chain transactions, which include paying fees and slow processing times.

## Transaction fees
Forgers on the Topl network stake arbits to validate transactions. These transactions are bundled in blocks by forgers and get appended to the Blockchain. 

Once a transaction is part of a block on the Topl Blockchain it is considered confirmed, and the more blocks that are forged on top of the block that contains the transaction, the lower the likelihood of a transaction being modified. 

In return for their service, forgers receive a block reward for each block they mine as well as the sum of all transaction fees users attached to their transactions

The transaction fee is currently configured at 1 poly, but once decentralization commences, the transaction fee will be based on the market value of a transaction. 

## TTL
time to live; how long a piece of data is valid)

## UTxO
Unspent transaction output; accounting mechanism in blockchain that enforces transaction uniqueness via consumption of state. A list of utxos is the input to a transaction on the blockchain.

## VM
Virtual Machine; execution environment, someplace code runs

## VRF
Verifiable Random Function; mechanism for leader election in Ouroboros proof-of-stake
