# Welcome to Apparatus' Developer Portal 

Here you'll find the tools and resources to interact with the Thunder Protocol. While we recommend starting by reading the [Apparatus Whitepaper](https://hackmd.io/@qiYljXhXTQeGAb1RWPghwQ/B1Y0YK0fp) to learn a bit more about our vision, mission, and tech, in short, Apparatus is unlocking the true global potential of web3 by solving the scalability problem for Bitcoin, the world’s most secure currency. With a relentless passion for financial inclusion, to date, Apparatus has powered the creation of a wide range of projects, from [supply chain traceability applications](https://seedtrace.org/case-study-with-koa) to the tokenization of different types of [social](https://apparatus.live/itp/) and [environmental](https://bcarbon.topl.co/) impact.

As we approach our main net launch, we are eagerly looking to grow our developer community, because we believe developers and project creators can use our tech to solve some of the most pressing financial inclusion challenges. Here is a brief overview of what the Apparatus ecosystem can offer you as a developer:

**Be a Part of the Fast-Growing Bitcoin Ecosystem**

Apparatus Thunder solves Bitcoin’s scalability problem with:

1. Micro-transactions using wrapped Bitcoin (tBTC) via Apparatus’s ground-breaking Taktikos PoS consensus mechanism with unprecedented data throughput
2. The battle-hardened security and decentralization of Bitcoin’s prevailing consensus mechanism – not a novel and untested alternative L1
3. A limitless new web3 ecosystem of smart contracts, dApps, DeFi, and NFTs – all secured by Bitcoin, the most trusted blockchain in existence


**Experience a Committed Community**

In addition to our Head of Developer Ecosystem, Apparatus has a team of core devs who are always excited to engage with developers building in our ecosystem. We hold regular community calls across platforms like Discord and Twitter, where together we dive into timely tech developments, share news about our roadmap, and provide opportunities for engagement. Additionally, if you're interested in contributing to Apparatus, you can find more information about bounties on our Dework profile (need to link once live).


**Take Advantage of Uniquely Good Timing**

Q4 of 2023 is an exciting time at Apparatus. In November, we will be launching Tetra, the newest and upgraded version of our protocol. In advance of that launch, we've opened up our test nets and would very much like your feedback on the following:
1. Running a test net node
2. Creating a wallet using our CLI
3. Writing transactions 


**Engage with our Robust Smart Contract Language— Quivr**

This domain-specific language offers an intuitive approach to creating and using assets in a UTXO-based blockchain.
