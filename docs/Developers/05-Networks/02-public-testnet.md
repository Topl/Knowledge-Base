Topl maintains a public testnet to enable developers and community memebers to become familiar with the Thunder protocol in a cost free environment. After setting up your node, simply connect through the gRPC or P2P endpoints listed below.

:::warning

The Thunder testnet is periodically refreshed so any data or transactions stored via the testnet will not be immutable or permanent.
