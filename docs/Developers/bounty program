**Topl's Community Bounty Program**

We're excited to be launching our community bounty program in December of 2023! We will post all Topl bounty opportunities to our [Dework space](https://app.dework.xyz/topl-97029/main-space-88431). 

We'd like to share with you the primary objectives of the Topl Bounty Program, and we hope that, regardless of your skills or expertise, we will be able to provide an opportunity for your contribution(s):

  1. To increase engagement in the Topl developer ecosystem and the broader Topl community by listing tasks (bounties) to be completed by external parties, reviewed by Topl team members (and, eventually, designated moderators), and rewarded. 
  2. To allow developers, creators, writers, builders, and thinkers to engage with and improve the Thunder protocol, tooling, and ecosystem in a fair and safe environment. 
  3. To utilize the skills and talents of the community to find bugs, thereby improving the security of the Topl network.
