Apparatus uses gRPC and Protobuf to handle communication channel formatting. [Protobuf specs](https://github.com/Topl/protobuf-specs/tree/main) can be compiled into their respective languages via [protoc-installation](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).

Currently, we publish compiled specs for Scala and Dart.
