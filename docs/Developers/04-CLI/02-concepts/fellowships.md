# Fellowships

A fellowship is a group of people who have agreed to participate lock funds
together according to a lock template. The lock template defines the terms
of the agreement. 

For example, if Alice and Bob agree to lock funds together and that to unlock
the funds they need to provide a signature from both of them, then they have
created a fellowship. The lock template in this case is the Quivr expression
`and(sign(0), sign(1))`. However, the lock template is not part of the 
fellowship, it is just the terms of the agreement. Indeed, the same fellowship
can enter into other agreements expressed by other templates.
