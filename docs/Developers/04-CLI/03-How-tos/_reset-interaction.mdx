Each time a transaction is created a new interaction is created. Sometimes
the transaction might not be useful or might be invalid. In this case, the
interaction can be reset. This command will set the interaction to a given value.

```bash
brambl-cli wallet set-interaction  --walletdb $WALLET_DB --from-fellowship $FELLOWSHIP --from-template $TEMPLATE --from-interaction $NEW_INTERACTION
```
