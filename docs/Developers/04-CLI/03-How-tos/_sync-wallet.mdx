To sync the wallet run the following command:

```bash
brambl-cli wallet sync --template-name $LOCK_TEMPLATE_NAME --fellowship-name $FELLOWSHIP_NAME --walletdb $WALLET -n $NETWORK -h $HOST --port $PORT --keyfile $KEYFILE -w $PASSWORD
```

This will sync the wallet for the fellowship `$FELLOWSHIP_NAME` and template `$LOCK_TEMPLATE_NAME` with the bifrost node running on `$HOST` on port `$PORT`. The keyfile `$KEYFILE` is used to derive keys. The password for the wallet is `$PASSWORD`. 

The procedure for the sync is the following:

- we first derive the next address for the fellowship and template
- we query the node to see if the UTXOs in that address are spent
- if the UTXOs are spent, then we derive the next address and repeat the process
