Each time a transaction is created a new interaction is created. To list all the interactions of a given wallet for a given fellowship and template, use the following command:

```bash
brambl-cli wallet list-interactions --walletdb $WALLETDB --fellowship-name $FELLOWSHIP --template-name $TEMPLATE
```

The result is given in the following format:

```bash
<fellowship id> <template id> <interaction id> <address at the location>
```
