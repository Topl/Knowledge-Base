# Tokenomics
### An overview of Topl’s two token system, the TOPL and the LVL

As a blockchain protocol, Topl is one of a select few chains utilizing a dual token model. The abilities to participate in block production (staking) and governance are gated by the TOPL, while transaction fees throughout the system are denominated and paid in LVLs (pronounced “levels”).

Topl’s choice to develop our own blockchain protocol allows us to correct the mistake inherent in nearly all other blockchain systems—forcing users to think about and use something as a currency without any currency properties to it. Exchange and payment are different from staking and governance, so the token design must be different too.
